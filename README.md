# rubiks_cube_algorithm

## Speed Test
Contains a few tests for brute forcing move sequences on cpu/gpu. The speed test 2 contains a few optimizations, including not repeating moves on the same facee, and containing hardcoded lookup tables for all of the moves.

## Algorithm_v1
Contains a modified verison of the Thistlethwaite Algorithm. 

## Algorithm_v2
Generally the same approach as v1, but the code has been completely restructured to be more clean and maintainable.
